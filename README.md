# Template Website

This is a template website that I am going to be using as I am learning web development and I will continue to add changes as I continue on my learning path (CSS Grid needs to be included and later some react elements etc).

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

Add your ideas here :)
